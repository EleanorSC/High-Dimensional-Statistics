# High Dimensional Statistics with R

This repository contains datasets and associated descriptions used for analyzing high-dimensional statistics with R. Below are the details of the datasets included in this project.

---

## Prostate Cancer Data

### **Source**
Prostate-specific antigen values and clinical measures for 97 patients hospitalized for a radical prostatectomy. Prostate specimens underwent histological and morphometric analysis.

### **Column Descriptions**
- **lcavol**: log(cancer volume)
- **lweight**: log(prostate weight)
- **age**: age of the patient
- **lbph**: log(benign prostatic hyperplasia amount)
- **svi**: seminal vesicle invasion
- **lcp**: log(capsular penetration)
- **gleason**: Gleason score
- **pgg45**: percentage Gleason scores 4 or 5
- **lpsa**: log(prostate specific antigen)

## Methylation Data

### **Source**
Illumina Human Methylation data from EPIC on sorted peripheral adult blood cell populations. The dataset records DNA methylation assays, which measure the proportion of DNA that carries a methyl mark. The assays are normalized methylation levels (M-values), with:
- Negative values: unmethylated DNA
- Positive values: methylated DNA

### **Data Object**
- **assay(data)**: normalized methylation levels
- **colData(data)**: individual-level metadata

### **Phenotypic Metadata**
- **Sample_Well**: sample well
- **Sample_Name**: name of sample
- **purity**: sample cell purity
- **Sex**: sex of the individual
- **Age**: age in years
- **weight_kg**: weight in kilograms
- **height_m**: height in meters
- **bmi**: body mass index (BMI)
- **bmi_clas**: BMI class
- **Ethnicity_wide**: ethnicity, wide class
- **Ethnic_self**: ethnicity, self-identified
- **smoker**: yes/no indicator of smoker status
- **Array**: type of array from the EPIC array library
- **Slide**: slide identifier

## Horvath Data

### **Source**
Methylation markers across different age groups. This dataset includes CpGmarker variables, which are CpG site encodings.

## Breast Cancer Gene Expression Data

### **Source**
Gene expression data obtained from microarray results of 91 breast cancer patient samples, along with metadata for the patients.

### **Data Object**
- **assay(data)**: gene expression data for each individual
- **colData(data)**: individual-level metadata

### **Phenotypic Metadata**
- **Study**: study identifier
- **Age**: age in years
- **Distant.RFS**: indicator of distant relapse-free survival
- **ER**: estrogen receptor positive or negative status
- **GGI**: gene expression grade index
- **Grade**: histologic grade
- **Size**: tumor size in cm
- **Time.RFS**: time between surgery and diagnosis of relapse (relapse-free survival time)

## Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Data

### **Source**
Gene expression measurements for over 9000 genes in over 3000 mouse cortex and hippocampus cells. These data are an excerpt of the original dataset.

### **Data Object**
- **assay(data)**: gene expression data
- **colData(data)**: metadata for individual cells

### **Cell Metadata**
- **tissue**: tissue type
- **group #**: group number
- **total mRNA mol**: total number of observed mRNA molecules corresponding to this cell’s unique barcode
- **well**: well where this cell’s cDNA was stored during processing
- **sex**: sex of the donor animal
- **age**: age of the donor animal
- **diameter**: estimated cell diameter
- **cell_id**: cell identifier
- **level1class**: cluster label identified via computational and manual annotation
- **level2class**: refined cluster label identified via computational and manual annotation
- **sizeFactor**: size factor estimated for scaling normalization (e.g., scran)
